I am a **Data Engineer** and **M.Sc. student in Artificial Intelligence** at **FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg**. With over **5 years of experience**, I focus on designing scalable data architectures and bridging the gap between robust engineering and advanced AI applications. My technical journey involves orchestrating complex pipelines and implementing production-ready solutions, including **RAG systems** and **Vector Databases**.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in AI in **Erlangen, Germany**, exploring how to build the next generation of intelligent infrastructure.

## Why the "Invisible City"? 

Data engineering is often called the "plumbing" of AI, but I prefer to think of it as an **Invisible City**.

Beneath every "smart" application lies a sprawling network of subway tunnels, storage depots, and high-speed express lines. If the tunnels are blocked (bad pipelines) or the depots are messy (unstructured data), the city above stops moving. My mission is to map these tunnels and make the complex machinery of data accessible to everyone through this blog.
